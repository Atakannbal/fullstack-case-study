# README

/server directory includes **/client** directory

You need to run npm install on both **/fullstack-case-study-main** and **/client** directories

Start the app from /server directory with

## npm run dev

### **The time spent on the case study**

2.5 days - not much prior experience with react/node

### **What would you do differently if you had more time**

I would work on error handling, replace the in-memory cache on server side with **redis**, use **hooks**, add **prop types** learn more about **redux** & **react router** and implement using those, some styling.

Would install linux container and dockerize had some issues with windows containers
