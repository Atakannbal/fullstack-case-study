# README
/server directory includes **/client** directory

 You need to run npm install on both **/fullstack-case-study-main** and **/client** directories

Start the app from /server directory with
 ## npm run dev

------------------------
### **The time spent on the case study**
2.5 days - not much prior experience with react/node

### **What would you do differently if you had more time**
I would work on error handling, replace the in-memory cache on server side with __redis__, use __hooks__, add __prop types__ learn more about __redux__ & __react router__ and implement using those, some styling.

Would install linux container and dockerize had some issues with windows containers
